# TMHelper
A helper app for Terraformin Mars board game

It is my first own Xamarin Android project. I am a first semester computer science student and wanted to get a little taste of mobile development during my winter holidays. In my stduies i have so far learned basics of C# and work with Razor Pages. So Android was a completely new area for me.

This app was created using Xamarin (C#, XML).
The icons used in the app are downloaded from material.io.

The Terraforming Mars Helper App helps TM players to calculate their final score and store the scores of played games.
